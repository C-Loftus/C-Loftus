### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Colton, a junior at Princeton studying Computer Science. I am particularly interested in systems and Linux. 
All repositories here are personal projects; my school projects are privated.

I am most experienced in Python and Rust but I also have taken classes where our assignments were in Java, C or C++
