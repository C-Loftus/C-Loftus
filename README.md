### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Colton, a senior at Princeton studying Computer Science. Some of my recent interests include Linux window managers, OS development, and accessibility software for people with disabilities. 
All repositories here are hobby projects; my school projects are privated. 

My projects here are mainly in Python and Rust, but I have also taken classes with assignments in Java, C and C++
