Hi, I'm Colton! 

I work on data engineering for the [Center for Geospatial Solutions](https://cgsearth.org/) at the [Lincoln Institute of Land Policy](https://www.lincolninst.edu/)

In my spare time I am interested in a11y and audiobook tools.

Please feel free to reach out to me on [my website](https://colton.place/contact/) or via email: [github@colton.place](mailto:github@colton.place)
