Hi, I'm Colton!

I love tech accessibility, Linux, and experimental HCI. My current focus is [combining screen readers/low-vision tech with voice dictation](https://github.com/C-Loftus/sight-free-talon). 

I graduated in 2023 from Princeton, focusing on ML and HCI. I currently work in healthcare consulting and am most experienced in Python, JS, and Rust.

Please feel free to reach out to me on my website [colton.bio](colton.bio)
