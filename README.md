### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Colton, a junior at Princeton studying Computer Science. I have recently been interested in Linux window managers as well as developing accessibility software for people with disabilities. 
All repositories here are hobby projects; my school projects are privated. 

My projects here are mainly in Python and Rust, but I have also taken classes with assignments in Java, C and C++
