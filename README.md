### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Colton, a junior at Princeton studying Computer Science. I am particularly interested in system design and Linux. 
All repositories here are personal projects; my school projects are privated.

My projects here are mainly in Python and Rust, but I have also taken classes with assignments in Java, C and C++
