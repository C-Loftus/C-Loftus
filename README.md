Hi, I'm Colton! 

I love working on projects related to tech accessibility, Linux, and experimental HCI.

I graduated in 2023 from Princeton, focusing on ML and HCI. I currently work in healthcare consulting and am most experienced in Python, JS, and Rust.

Please feel free to reach out to me on [my website](https://colton.place/)
